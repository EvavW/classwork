notes of boundary values

no lab: just lecture

Physics overview:
	Kinematics a
	Dynamics F
	Field Equation V
a= F/M links kinematics and dynamics
F = alphaV

source equations
charge distrobution
mass distrobution

how do we get the potentials from the sources?

d^2V/dx^2 = p(x) : Poisson Equation

VV(Xl = Vl , V(Xr) = Vr : boundary values
