best fit algorithm:

distnace between line of best fit and each data point
to actually calculate: n sum i=1 (yi - (axi + b))^2 where yi is the point on the best fit  line where the vertical hits
to minimize the function: take the derivitae in resoect to a and to be and set each to zero
d/da(function)=0
d/db(function)=0
derivative = n sum i=1 (-2xi(yi-axi-b)=0
n sum i=1 (-2()=0

on the computer: use matricies

from above equations:
sum xi (a*xi + b ) = sum (xi*yi)
sum(axi + b) = sum (yi)

variables fo matrix form: a and b:
[a]*[sum xi^2, sum xi, ] = [sum xiyi]
b	sum xi , n 		sum yi

how to get the inverse of a two by two matrix: 1/matrix * switch top left and bottom right, make top right and bottom left negative

a	1/                n -sumxi         
b = 	sumxi^2 sumxi *   -sumxi sumxi2  * sumxiyi  = a mess that a computer will do for you
	sumxi 	n			   sumyi
