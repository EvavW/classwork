least squares

method minimize Chi-Squared

minimuze the sum of the squares of the deviations between the data point and the straight line
Chi Squares= sum of the square for each of the deviations 
	first square all of the deviations and them sum them all
		deivations are weightedby Sigmai which corresponds to the size of each data point
		in ours we will have al data subject ot he same error 

so how do we solve the minimization?

take the dereivative of chi Squares in respect to a1 and a2 and set each equal to zero

results that (see program sheet)


how are we going to store the data?

singma = 1/2?

best possible storage mechanism: load all of the data into three arrays
	array review:
		double x[100], y[100], sig[100];
		int n, i; 
		double *sums* sx,sy,sxx,sxy,s
how to count data items as they are read in?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int 
main()
{
	*/data/* 
	double x[100], y[100], sig[100]; 
	*/ accumulators for the running sums*/
	double s, sx, sxx, sy, sxy;
	doulbe a1, a2, sa1, sa2;
	*/ file pointer*/
	FILE *fp;
	*/ i dont even know. i never know*/
	int n, i;


	fp = fopen("data.txt", "r");

	n = 0;

	while(fscan(fp, "%le %le %le", &x[n], &y[n], &sig[n]) != EOF) n++;

	printf("%d data points read from data.txt\n", n);

	return 0;
}
